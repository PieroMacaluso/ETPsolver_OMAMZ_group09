	\section{Building conflict matrix}
	
	Was done by taking each couple of exams and counting students enrolled in both. This was agonizingly slow, taking about 20 seconds on istance 6.
	
	Also, it was a mistake since before that it worked differently but the entire data structure has been changed multiple times.
	
	It was later improved by iterating over students once and, for each student, taking every couple of exams they're enrolled in and incrementing the right cell in the conflict matrix.
	
	Finding this performance problem (which appeared by mistake, mind you) required us to use a profiler, but nobody cares about stuff that's really useful in the real world and we'll almost surely use in future (these absurd algorithms... most of us will never see them again).

	\section{Initial solution generation}
	
	\subsection{Random}
	
	Initially we tried generating random starting solutions: that is, to each exam assign a random time slot. This was very fast, but even after thousands of runs we couldn't find even a single feasible solution on ``real'' instances. It worked on the ``test'' instance, however.
	
	\subsection{Greedy 1 (``Extremely Stupid Greedy'')}
	
	We tried to implement a very simplistic greedy algorithm:
	
	\begin{algorithm}[H]
		%\KwData{dati}
		%\KwResult{risultato}
		%initialization\;
		\ForEach{exam}{
			\ForEach{timeslot}{
				\If{exam can be scheduled in timeslot}{
					assign exam to timeslot\;
					break (evaluate next exam)\;
				}
			}
		}
		\caption{The very simplistic greedy algorithm}
	\end{algorithm}

	This never yielded a feasible solution, as when it got near the end of the exam list there were no more non-conflicting time slots available.
	
	It should be noted that this algorithm is deterministic, as it always produced the same solution.
	
	\subsection{Greedy 2 (``Slightly More Cultured Greedy'')}
	
	An attempt was made to introduce nondeterminism in the previously mentioned greedy algorithm. This was achieved by randomizing the order in which time slots are examined: again, this never yielded a single feasible solution, even after hundreds of runs.
	
	\subsection{Greedy 3 (``Timeslots and Conflicts'')}
	
	This time we tried to give a profitable order to the exams. Initially, we decided to order them by the number of conflicts at the start of the algorithm and to give them a random timeslot from the one available and feasible for the current exam. This solution was simple but led us to a solution only with \textit{instance01}, so we decided to order the exams in another way: first by the number of unavailable timeslots (timeslots with exams in conflict) and then by the number of conflicts. 
	
	\begin{algorithm}[H]
		%\KwData{dati}
		%\KwResult{risultato}
		%initialization\;
		create a list of ordered exam by (number of unavailable slot, number of conflicts)\;
		\While{there are exam to be scheduled in the list}{
			set \textit{E} as the first exam in the ordered list\;
			set \textit{T} as a random timeslot from the feasible ones\;
			assign E to T\;
			remove E from the list\;
			reorder list of exam\;
		}	
		\caption{Algorithm with Timeslots and Conflicts order}
	\end{algorithm}

	This was a great step forward, but there was still no solutions from the other instances.

	
	\subsection{Greedy 4 (``First Feasible Solution Creation'')}
	
	\subsection{Greedy 5 (``Cached First Feasible Solution Creation'')}
	
	
	
	\section{Further solutions generation}
	
	\subsection{Genetic algorithm}
	
	We tried running a genetic algorithm implementation anyway, with ``Random'' and ``Greedy 2'' initial solutions especially. It worked fine in the test instance, reaching the optimum solution in around 5-10 iterations with single-point crossover and a mutation (assigning a random time slot to an exam) probability of $0.1$, on real instances it never produced a feasible solution, not even after thousands of iterations.
